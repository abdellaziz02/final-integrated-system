I was pulling into Costco today when a wave of starvation hit me. It was obvious that I should hit the food court before so I could properly execute the buy (not overspend). I thought I'd try this relatively new menu item and get a review out since it's been a bit.

Nowadays the price-point of $9.99 would be thrilling to see at a deli, but Costco is a different breed. The food court is home to a $1.99 slice of pizza and the infamous $1.50 hot dog. Even an entire pizza will cost you less. Tough competition in terms of value.

As you can see, this is a pretty basic looking roast beef sandwich. Something you could whip up in little effort at home. I thought the decision to go cheese-less was disappointing. The sauce was the classic 1-2 punch of mayo and yellow mustard.

Nothing super exciting here but it was still fairly enjoyable. I loved the roasted cherry tomatoes but thought they were applied too scarcely. You'd get one every third bite or so and it changed the entire flavor of the sandwich for the better.

If they add cheese, toast the bread and double the portion of cherry tomatoes this could be a pretty good sandwich. Unfortunately it was just decent and hard to justify for the price. Next time I'll stick with the slice of pizza or hot dog."". ",0,0,1,27,16,0.00209243075602054,0,1,0
